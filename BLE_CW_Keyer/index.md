[CWComfort, my morse keyer software, one with a lazy attitude](/cw/)

## So far
* ComfortTXusbhost is a controller, having one input (an USB connected keyboard), and one output (BLE to ComfortTX). Myself I do use a wireless USB keyboard, now we already are "wireless"
* ComfortTX is a generic CW keyer, controlled via BLE commands. 
* Arduino code is [here](https://github.com/Fihl/BLE_CW_Keyer)
